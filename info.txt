Building an offline-only web app with features like web-sharing, password management, and group chat is a unique challenge since it limits the use of external servers and real-time internet-based services. Here's how you can approach this project:

1. Project Structure & Stack
Frontend:

Framework: React.js or Vue.js for creating a modular, component-based UI.
UI Library: Tailwind CSS or Material UI for a clean, responsive design.
State Management: Use local state management or something lightweight like Zustand for managing application state without relying on internet-based solutions.
Service Workers: To handle caching and offline capabilities.
IndexedDB: For storing and managing data offline (passwords, chat messages, files).
Security:

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for securing all data locally.
Secure Storage: Use IndexedDB or localStorage with encryption for sensitive data.
Implement client-side input validation and sanitization to ensure security.
2. Features Breakdown
Web-sharing
Offline Support: Use the File System Access API for direct file access and management on the user's device.
Local Sharing: Implement Bluetooth or WebRTC for local peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing without internet access.
File Management: Allow users to drag and drop files within the app, and organize them using local storage.
Password Management
Password Vault: Store passwords securely in IndexedDB, encrypted using AES or similar.
Autofill: Implement an autofill feature for offline forms by parsing form fields and populating them with stored passwords.
Password Generator: Create a local password generator to help users create strong passwords.
Group Chat
Local Chat: Use WebRTC Data Channels or Bluetooth for local device-to-device messaging.
Offline Messaging: Store messages locally in IndexedDB, allowing users to access them even when disconnected from other devices.
Group Management: Admin features for managing users locally, such as adding/removing devices.
3. Steps to Build
Initial Setup:

Set up your development environment with React/Vue.
Implement basic routing and UI components.
Configure IndexedDB for offline data storage.
PWA Setup:

Implement service workers to handle caching and offline capabilities.
Create a manifest.json file to allow the app to be installed on devices.
Feature Development:

Web-sharing: Implement the File System Access API for direct file access, and P2P sharing via WebRTC or Bluetooth.
Password Management: Develop the secure storage and autofill functionalities.
Group Chat: Create a local chat system using WebRTC Data Channels or Bluetooth, allowing users to communicate without internet access.
Security Enhancements:

Implement encryption for all locally stored data.
Add client-side validation and sanitization to prevent potential security issues.
Testing & Debugging:

Thoroughly test the app in various offline scenarios, ensuring all features function correctly without internet.
Perform security audits to ensure data is securely stored and managed.
Deployment:

Since the app is offline-only, you won't need a typical deployment. Instead, package the app as an installable PWA.
Distribute the app via direct download links, QR codes, or sideloading on devices.
4. Tools & Libraries
idb: A wrapper around IndexedDB for easier use.
WebRTC: For local peer-to-peer communication.
CryptoJS: For encrypting sensitive data stored offline.
PWA Builder: For creating and testing PWA features.
Bluetooth API: For device-to-device communication.
5. Version Control & Collaboration
Git/GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
Project Management: Tools like Trello or Jira for tracking progress and tasks.
Challenges & Considerations:
Device Compatibility: Ensure that features like WebRTC and Bluetooth are supported on the devices you’re targeting.
Data Sync: Since there’s no internet, consider how or if data should sync between devices when they reconnect.
Would you like to focus on a particular feature first, such as local file sharing or the chat system?
